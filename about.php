	   Dear my charming wife,<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I wanted to write you a love letter.
		I know it’s a little silly but I thought I’d try anyway.
		It’s just that I feel so much when I’m with you that I try to put it in words, so that you know how I feel about you. 
		I can't see you right now but I can picture how you are.
		I see your hair and the way it falls on your shoulders, the way you smile and how you look right before you laugh.
		I want to be next to you right now. 
		I don’t want you to hold anything back. 
		I can feel you close to me even though you're far away.
		Please believe me when I say I love you. 	
		
		
		</p>

       <p>
	   
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I think about the time before you were a part of my life.
	I remember being aimlessly drifting from one place to another, for I was bereft a cause in my life. 
	Along came you and from that day forth everything changed.
	You have given me so much that I can never pay you back and I know that I can only spend my lifetime loving you and make you feel safe and secure in my arms.
	I know that you are that once in a lifetime gift that is bestowed upon lucky ones from heaven above and you mean the world to me.

       <p>
	   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My life is beautiful because of you my love my lady love. 
	   You entered into my life as a candlelight in the dark.
	   You showed me the meaning of love not with your words but with your care.
	   I know your shy nature doesn’t let you open up to me; but your eyes speak up the love you have for me.
	   </p>

       <p>
	    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Not a day goes by when my mind does not think of you, you are the reason behind every joy that has ever been a part of my life. You are the one who made me see the beauty of things. Before you came into my life, I was sad, alone and broken. Then you came in and turned my world around and changed everything for the better. I cannot thank you enough, all I can do to repay you is to love you unconditionally and whole heartedly. You are every dream of mine come true and I love you with all my heart and soul.
